# UN-CENSUS
--Mini Project for college.

We got a dataset of the US census in which we predicted the income (>=50k or <50k) based on the columns using Supervised Learning.

We applied 5 classification models: Logistic Regression, Gaussian Naive Bayes, SVC, Decision Tree Classifier & Voting Classifier.

Thus arriving accurately at the best result with the Ensemble model i.e. the Voting Classifier.
